# podio-component

The Podio integration component for the AVA / thatapp.io iPaaS platform.

This component is an `elasticio-sailor-nodejs` connector exposing ~100 actions
and 5 triggers against Podio's REST API at `https://api.podio.com`. It is
hardened against the platform-side reliability classes documented below —
the most important being safe-retry semantics for transient errors, an
idempotent item-create pattern, and rate-limit-aware backoff.

## Setup

### Podio OAuth app

1. In Podio (https://podio.com/settings/api), create a new API client. Name
   it after your customer-facing brand; pick "Server-side flow" type.
2. Set the OAuth redirect URI to your platform's credential-exchange endpoint
   (typically `https://your-tenant.io/callback/oauth2`).
3. Record the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. These map to the
   component's environment variables:

   - `PODIO_APP_ID` → the OAuth client id
   - `PODIO_APP_SECRET` → the OAuth client secret

More information at https://developers.podio.com/authentication.

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatapp/podio-component.git
cd podio-component
npm install

# Create test/.env from the example, populate OAuth client + a test account
cp test/.env.example test/.env

# Run any single action against the live API using the local test runner
node test/run.js lib/actions/items/getItem getItem
node test/run.js lib/actions/items/createItem createItem
```

The local runner reads fixtures from `test/fixtures/<actionName>.json` and
falls back to `test/fixture.json` for shared inputs.

### Deploying

This component is built and published by the AVA platform's CI pipeline
(`buildType: docker` in `component.json`). Pushing to the `master` branch
triggers an internal build; the component appears in customer flow editors
once the build publishes. There is no manual `docker build` step required
of contributors.

        |        - 420  -> err.retry=true, lets sailor auto-retry
        |        - 5xx  -> err.retry=true, lets sailor auto-retry
        |        - 4xx  -> normalized error with kind / errorParameters / errorPropagate
        |   -- rate-limit headroom WARN when < 500 remaining
        v
[api.podio.com]
```

Key files:

- `podio.js` — HTTP wrapper. Owns the response handler, token refresh lock,
  and the central error-normalizer integration.
- `helpers/errors.js` — central Podio error normalizer with diagnostic
  classification (ROUTE_GONE / RESOURCE_MISSING / FORBIDDEN /
  INVALID_REFERENCE / RATE_LIMIT / SERVER_ERROR / PROVIDER_ERROR / OTHER)
  and the `err.retry=true` signal that drives sailor's auto-retry.
- `helpers/refTypes.js` — Podio's 69-member `ref_type` registry classified
  into 33 resolvable, 28 reserved, 8 resolver-crashers.
- `helpers/podioEnums.js` — centralized enum constants harvested from the
  live API (view layouts, hook event types, grant actions, task grouping,
  etc.). Single source of truth for these values across the connector.
- `helpers/redact.js` — masks credentials in logged Podio responses
  (mailbox, calendar_code, push.signature, access_token, refresh_token).
- `lib/actions/` — ~100 action files grouped by Podio area (items, apps,
  comments, files, hooks, etc.).
- `lib/triggers/` — 5 polling/webhook-receiver triggers.

## Operational notes

### OAuth token lifetime

Podio access tokens have an **8-hour TTL** and refresh tokens roll on each
refresh. The component refreshes reactively on `401`. Concurrent 401s
during a large batch are serialized in-process via a refresh-lock so the
second-place caller doesn't race the first.

### Rate limit

Partner-tier accounts are budgeted at **75,000 calls/hour** by Podio. When
the remaining-budget header drops below `500`, the component logs a WARN
to the platform's executions panel. When you hit a 420 (rate-limit) or any
5xx (server error), the response is marked `err.retry=true` and the
sailor's built-in **10-retry exponential backoff** takes over automatically.
You do not need to write a custom backoff loop.

### Reliable batch creation (the canonical pattern)

The default `createItem` action **already does the right thing for
individual records**: it propagates errors to the iPaaS execution UI's
error channel, retryable errors auto-retry. For batches where you need a
*guarantee* that every upstream record landed in Podio:

1. Make each upstream record carry a **stable upstream id** as `external_id`
   (source-system row id, UUID — anything unique per record).
2. Use **`Item: Create (Idempotent by external_id)`** instead of `Item: Create`.
   It looks up by `external_id` first and returns the existing item if a
   prior retry already landed it — no duplicates. The output's
   `_idempotent_status` field is `"existing"` or `"created"`.
3. At the end of the batch, route the list of `external_ids` you tried to
   write into **`Item: Reconcile Batch (by external_id)`**. It returns
   `{found, missing, errors, *_count}` — `missing` lists exactly which
   upstream records did not make it to Podio.
4. Route `missing.length > 0` back into `createItemIdempotent` to re-feed
   the gaps.

This is belt-and-suspenders — you don't trust the iPaaS execution count,
you trust Podio's own state. It is the standard pattern for high-stakes
Podio integrations.

### Webhooks: the calculation-field trap

Podio does **not** fire `item.update` events for calculation-field
recomputes. The recompute is asynchronous and continuous; firing webhooks
on every cascade step would create webhook storms with ambiguous timing,
so Podio deliberately suppresses them. This means:

- A field-level webhook (`app_field` scope) on a calculation field is
  **registerable** but **never fires**.
- The connector's `Hooks: Create` action will detect and refuse this when
  you set the optional `appId` config — see the action description.

The canonical bridge: use a Podio Workflow Automation flow to copy the
calculated value into a regular *stored* field (text/date/number), and
subscribe the webhook to that stored field instead. The stored-field write
triggers a real `item.update` event.

### Error vocabulary

The central error normalizer produces an `Error` carrying:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `err.statusCode` | HTTP status code from Podio |
| `err.podioError` | Podio's `error` keyword (e.g. `not_found`, `forbidden`, `rate_limit`) |
| `err.errorParameters` | Podio's `error_parameters` object — carries the "Must be one of {...}" allowed set for enum-constrained params |
| `err.errorPropagate` | true = error came from an upstream/provider integration; surface verbatim, do not retry |
| `err.kind` | Diagnostic class (see helpers/errors.js) |
| `err.retry` | `true` for 420 and 5xx — drives sailor's auto-retry |

When the API rejects a value as out-of-set (e.g. an invalid view layout),
`errorParameters` carries the allowed values — the user-visible error string
should surface them. The `formatUserError(err)` helper in `helpers/errors.js`
handles this.

### Logging + redaction

Use `this.logger.info/.warn/.error` (Bunyan via the sailor) for all
operational logging — `info` and above appear on the platform's executions
page. For any Podio response body that goes into a log line, wrap it via
`helpers/redact.js`'s `safeStringify(body)` so sensitive fields
(`mailbox`, `calendar_code`, `push.signature`, OAuth tokens) are masked.

### Search v1 vs v2

For scoped searches (`searchOrg`, `searchSpace`), both v1 and v2 are live —
exposed as sibling actions:

- `Search: Organization (v1)` / `Search: Space (v1)` → bare array result.
  Compact, no facet counts. Use when you just want matches.
- `Search: Organization (v2 with counts)` / `Search: Space (v2 with counts)`
  → `{counts, results}` envelope. Pass `counts=true` to populate
  per-`ref_type` aggregate counts. Use for faceted UIs.

Both return the same 13-key result-row schema. For unscoped global search,
only v2 exists (the v1 unscoped global route is dead).

## Triggers

The component exposes 5 triggers:

- `getApplications` — polling: fetches one app by id; emits per cycle.
- `getItems` — polling: fetches one item by id; emits per cycle.
- `getOrganisations` — polling: fetches one org by id; emits per cycle.
- `getSpaces` — polling: fetches spaces for an org.
- `verifyHooks` — webhook receiver: handles Podio's hook-verification handshake.

**Note (in-progress):** A dedicated `podio-webhook` component is being
designed to subsume the current two-flow webhook-install ceremony into a
single lifecycle-aware trigger (install/verify on `startup`, emit events
on `process`, optional cleanup on `shutdown`). Until that ships, the
current `Hooks: Create` + `Hook: Verify` pattern remains the way to
manage webhooks.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to check |
|---|---|---|
| "Platform shows 1000 processed, Podio is missing some" | Errors lost / not retried | Confirm B.4/B.5 retry logic is active. Add `reconcileBatch` to the flow and re-feed `missing`. |
| `err.kind === 'ROUTE_GONE'` | Connector bug — wrong endpoint | This means the path we hit does not exist on Podio. File an issue with the action name. |
| `err.kind === 'RESOURCE_MISSING'` | User error — bad id | The path exists; the referenced item/app/etc. doesn't. |
| `err.kind === 'FORBIDDEN'` | Auth/scope issue | The token doesn't have rights on this object. Re-auth or use a different OAuth client. |
| `err.kind === 'INVALID_REFERENCE'` | User passed a reserved `ref_type` | See `helpers/refTypes.js` — the type is in Podio's registry but not resolvable via `/reference`. |
| `err.kind === 'RATE_LIMIT'` | 420 hit | Auto-retries via sailor. If persistent, the workload exceeds 75k/hr. |
| Webhook on a field never fires | The field is a calculation field | See "Webhooks: the calculation-field trap" above. Use the stored-field bridge. |
